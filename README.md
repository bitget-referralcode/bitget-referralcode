What is Bitget referral code and how to use it in 2025? Hey Bitgetters! Recently, my name is StockMen. Bitget has launched several promotions that encourage you to refer new users. Many of you have asked how to share your referral codes or links, and how your friends can sign up on Bitget using them.ðŸ‘‹

## What is a Bitget referral code?ðŸ‘‹

First, each user has a unique referral code designed to encourage them to invite friends to join Bitget and trade together. Second, the referral code acts as the link between you and your invited friends. When a friend enters your referral code while signing up, they will be identified as your invitee, and both of you will receive rewards through the referral relationship.

Some users might miss this step and wonder, "What should I do if I forgot to give the referral code to my friends?" To avoid such issues, here's how you can use the referral code.
